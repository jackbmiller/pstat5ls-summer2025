# Introduction

This week, we'll be using a random sample of 300 entries from this [data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md) from the Coffee Quality Database collected from the Coffee Quality Institute's [review pages](https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/) in January 2018 by BuzzFeed data scientist [James Ledoux](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database). Members of the Coffee Quality Institute tasted and recorded their feedback for the coffee. The data are available to you in `coffee_sample.csv`. 

You might find useful the below descriptions of *some* of the variables (from <https://www.coffeereview.com/interpret-coffee/>)

- **Aroma** refers to smell: "How intense and pleasurable is the aroma when the nose first descends over the cup and is enveloped by fragrance?"
- **Acidity** "is the bright, dry sensation that enlivens the taste of coffee"
- **Balance** "appears to mean that no one quality overwhelms all others, but there is enough complexity in the coffee to arouse interest."
- "**Body** and mouthfeel describe sensations of weight and texture. Body can be light and delicate, heavy and resonant, thin and disappointing; in texture it can be silky, plush, syrupy, lean or thin.
- "**Flavor** and **aftertaste** include everything not suitably described under the categories aroma, acidity and body.
- **Clean cup** is referring to the absence of non-coffee tastes or aromas in the cup.
- **Cupper points** are an individual rater's holistic perception of the cup.
- **Total cup points** is the sum of the ratings for flavor, aroma, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, sweetness, "clean cup", and cupper points.

Here's some more information about coffee tasting that you might find interesting: <https://www.coffeeiq.co/en/a-look-at-coffee-tasting/>. 

## Research Questions

1. Which of the variables body, acidity, or balance is the best predictor of a coffee's total cup points? Why?
2. Create a graphical display (plot) including the linear regression line using the variable you chose in question 1 (to best predict total cup points) and total cup points.
3. Using the plot you created for Question 2, comment on the relationship between the two variables (in terms of the overall form, the direction of the association, the strength of the association, and if there are any unusual features). 
4. Write the equation for the least-squares regression line. Include context. 

# Background

## Population of Interest

Replace this text with information about the population of interest.

## About the Data

Replace this text with information about the data, such as the sample size, how it was collected, etc. You may need to skip ahead to the Results section to run code to help you. You don't need to worry about discussing the variables.

## Study Design

Replace this text with whether this data was collected as part of an observational study or an experiment, and how you know this.

# Methods

Replace this text with a description of what you will be doing in the section called "Results". Then in the section called "Results", you'll create the R code to analyse your data and create the appropriate output. We have created several chunks to help you. Delete this text once you are ready to begin.

# Results

```{r readInData, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to read in the data set. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

```{r chunk1, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the research question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

```{r chunk2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the research question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

```{r chunk3, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the research question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

```{r chunk4, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the research question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

# Conclusion

Replace this text with the answer to the research question. Be sure to include all relevant context and to use support from your Results section.
